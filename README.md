# Hangman
First python project. Hangman in Jupyter Notebook

Notes:
1. Used list because strings are immutable according to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1228299/change-one-character-in-a-string
2. Used enumerate function to count numbers of correct letters in answer word. Code from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6294179/how-to-find-all-occurrences-of-an-element-in-a-list
3. 


Things to do:
1. Find a way to randomly select a word (preferably based on difficulty level)
2. Make a list of letters used and display it for user
3. Find efficiency in the code  
4. Make a GUI with mouse pointer functionality
